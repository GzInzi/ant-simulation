# üêú ant-simulation - Experience Ant Intelligence in Action

## üåü Overview
Welcome to the **ant-simulation** project. This application offers a unique simulation of an ant colony's behavior using Pygame. You will witness how simple physical rules guide ants, highlighting their emergent intelligence. The simulation also introduces a novel "Mental Fatigue" mechanism, which helps ants escape dynamic loops.
